# Jack Johnson's portfolio

## Description

This web application is a portfolio showcasing my completed front-end web development projects. Rather than navigating through repositories on GitHub, this portfolio allows me to easily show my projects to family, friends and prospective employers.

Skills and proficiencies evidenced in my projects:

- Layouts: Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Languages: HTML5 and CSS3

## Installation

Simply click on the URL and you will be navigated to the web application in your default browser.

## Usage

URL: https://drrobotnik7.github.io/portfolio/

Click on the links in the navigation bar to smoothly scroll to the relevant section of the website.

Hover over various elements to add some colour to the website and take aim at the nefarious Dr.Robotnik!

Click on the project tiles and you will be directed to the selected web application in a new tab in your browser.

Note that currently only the Horiseon and Prework tiles currently point to a valid URL. The other images are placeholders...for now! The cursor will change to a 'not-allowed' cursor when you hover over these placeholders.

## Credits

Many thanks to the EdX team for teaching me the coding skills needed to complete this portfolio and the projects within it. 

I would also like to acknowledge my peers in Sibert-pod-11. We're all on the same learning journey and have helped each other massively during the front-end web development skills boot camp.
