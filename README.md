## Credits

Many thanks to the EdX team for teaching me the coding skills needed to complete this portfolio and the projects within it. 

I would also like to acknowledge my peers in Sibert-pod-11. We're all on the same learning journey and have helped each other massively during the front-end web development skills boot camp.
